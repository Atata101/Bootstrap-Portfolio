# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description
A journey of a thousand mile starts with one step.
This portfolio tracks all my work as I journey towards becoming a developer. This will be a catalogue of all the work I have done and the ones I am yet to do.
The projects and mini projects I have done so far are listed here in grid. 
And yes you may find some boring stuffs here, but be rest assured they will be improved on or refactored as I learn.
